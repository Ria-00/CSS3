                NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) is a powerful feature of the Nmap network scanning tool that allows users to write and run scripts to automate and extend 
                Nmap's capabilities. NSE scripts are written in the Lua programming language and can perform a wide range 
                of tasks, such as vulnerability scanning, service discovery, and network mapping.A suite of scripts in NSE 
                refers to a collection of related scripts that work together to perform a specific task or target a specific 
                vulnerability or service.

            <h1>Para @</h1>
            <p>For example, the "http" suite of scripts contains scripts that can be used to scan 
                and enumerate web servers, detect vulnerabilities, and retrieve information about web applications running on the server.The role 
                of a suite of scripts in NSE is to provide a convenient and efficient way to perform a specific set of 
                tasks on a network or system. By grouping related scripts together, users can easily target a specific 
                vulnerability or service without having to manually select and run each script individually. This can save 
                time and effort, especially in large and complex networks.</p>

            <h1>Para #</h1>
            <p> In addition, suites of scripts are often updated 
                and maintained by the Nmap community, which ensures that they stay up-to-date with the latest vulnerabilities
                 and services. This makes NSE a valuable tool for security professionals and network administrators who need
                  to stay on top of emerging threats and vulnerabilities on their networks.</p>
